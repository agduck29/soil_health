Nacogdoches Soil Health Study
The project is a collection of eight soil samplings conducted quarterly since 2018.
The samples have been seen to three different labs, Haney, SFA, and Ward for analysis.
The project showcases different ways to conceptualize the data through RStudios statistics.
The data can also be viewed at: https://agduck29.shinyapps.io/soil_health/
