<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Nacogdoches Soil Health Study is an ongoing multi-disciplinary collaboration between the USDA-NRCS, the Nacogdoches SWCD, and local landowners. The purpose of the project is to learn the variability in soil health metrics on different land uses in east Texas. Beginning in early 2018, initial site selection took place at the East Texas Plant Material Center (ETPMC). The PMC was chosen because of its central location and ease of access to multiple land-uses within close proximity. Samples are gathered quarterly to discern any changes due to seasonality. Eight site locations were chosen, representative of common land uses in the Pineywoods ecosystems.</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>Quarterly, all eight sample locations are taken on the same day by digging 6 inches of soil from the surface.&nbsp; The soil is placed in a 5 gallon bucket and thoroughly mixed to ensure homogeneity. Three sample bags are filled with roughly 500 grams of soil for distribution and analysis to each of the following laboratories.</p>

<p>The Grassland Soil and Water Research Laboratory provides soil health analysis though the Soil Health Tool. The methods use nature&rsquo;s biology and chemistry by: (1) using a soil microbial activity indicator; (2) a soil water extract (nature&rsquo;s solvent); and (3) the H3A extractant, which mimics the production of organic acids by living plant roots to temporarily change the soil pH, thereby increasing nutrient availability. These organic acids are then broken down by soil microbes since they are an excellent carbon source, which returns the soil pH to its natural, ambient level. More information can be found at <a href="ars.usda.gov/plains-area/temple-tx">ars.usda.gov/plains-area/temple-tx</a>.</p>
 
<p>The Stephen F. Austin University (SFA) Soil, Plant &amp; Water Analysis Laboratory provides a complete soil test of pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, iron, copper, zinc, and manganese levels. The lab was established in 1952 to meet the soil testing needs of the East Texas community. As time progressed plant and water analyses were added.&nbsp; The Lab also functions in support of the educational programs in the Agriculture Department and provides analytical services for faculty and students involved in research in the department as well as across campus. A variety of services are provided to meet the needs of growers and others involved with agriculture in the East Texas area and beyond. More information can be found at <a href="ag.sfasu.edu">ag.sfasu.edu</a>.</p>

<p>Ward Laboratories tests soil biology by analyzing phospholipid fatty acids, or PLFA. PLFA gives a representation of living soil microbial biomass and allows the identification of the presence or absence of various functional groups of interest through known PLFA biomarkers. PLFA is a snapshot of soil community structure and abundance at the time of sampling. As environmental conditions such as temperature and moisture change so does the microbial community. This ability of the soil microbial community to change provides producers with a tool to compare agricultural management techniques with respect to overall better microbial community health.

<h3>Results and Discussion</h3>
<p>Contained within this database are the results from all labs. Each tab provides differing analysis capabilities to for comparison. The <em>Images, Maps, </em>and <em>Raw Data </em>tabs are self-explanatory, but the other tabs use statistical methods to visualize results. One caveat, while the dataset is relatively complete, some sampling metrics were not reported. This provides gaps in the Correlation Plots and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) because null data must be removed. If a metric (Y-axis) is null, then the whole data row (X-axis) is removed and not used in comparison (see <em>Raw Data</em>).</p>

<p><em>Boxplots</em></p>
<p>Boxplots display data based on the minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), maximum, and outliers. The median is the middle of the dataset, while the minimum and maximum are the lowest and highest data points, excluding outliers. Quartiles are the middle values between the smallest/largest (not min or max) and the median. The whiskers show the variability outside the upper and lower quartiles.</p>

<p><em>Correlation Plot</em></p>
<p>Correlation plots provide insight to data relationships by comparing strength and direction. Strength is determined by the numerical value while direction is positive or negative.&nbsp; A positive correlation means both variables move in the same direction and the closer the value is to 1, the higher the correlation. The inverse is true for negative correlations, their values move in different directions and their correlation is closer to -1. No correlations have values near 0 and indicate no apparent relationship.</p>

<p><em>Principal Components Analysis</em></p>
<p>PCA is a mathematical algorithm that reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variation in the dataset. This reduction is accomplished by identifying directions, called principal components, along which the variation in the data is maximal. By using a few components, each sample can be represented by relatively few numbers instead of by values for thousands of variables. Samples can then be plotted, making it possible to visually assess similarities and differences between samples and determine whether samples can be grouped.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>The goal is to release the results and dynamically allow each user to find unique outputs. If fruitful, then additional tabs will be created showcasing revealing analysis that helps better understand the data.</p>
